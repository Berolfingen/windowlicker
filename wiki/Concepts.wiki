#summary A glossary of Window Licker concepts

=== Gesture ===

An interaction with the user interface via the mouse and/or keyboard.  Window Licker runs tests by performing Gestures and observing the results.  

There are a number of primitive gestures, such as pressing a mouse button, releasing a mouse button, moving the mouse, moving the mouse wheel, pressing a key and releasing a key. Gestures can be composed from other gestures.  For example, typing a character is a sequence of three gestures: pressing the key, waiting a short while and finally releasing a key.  Typing text is a sequence of gestures, each of which types one character.

The [http://code.google.com/p/windowlicker/source/browse/trunk/java/com/objogate/wl/gesture/Gestures.java Gestures] class contains syntactic sugar for describing gestures to make test code easier to read.

The vocabulary of gestures is extensible.  A new gesture can be written by implementing the [http://code.google.com/p/windowlicker/source/browse/trunk/java/com/objogate/wl/Gesture.java Gesture interface] and writing a factory function to act as synctactic sugar.
